# Music Store Analysis Using SQL

This is my first SQL project to analyze online music store data

This project will show you how to analyze the digital music store database. I have examine the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering simple and complex questions based on geopgraphical growth, purchase power, total revenue, genre performance, music band popularity, best city in terms of revenue and best customer in terms of purchase rate.

This analysis will provide great insight to the stake holders to take right and effective decisions.
